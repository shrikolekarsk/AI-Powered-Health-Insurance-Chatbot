# AI-Powered-Health-Insurance-Chatbot
This project is a full-stack AI-powered chatbot built using Streamlit (frontend) and a RAG-SQL backend. It allows users to ask natural language questions about a health insurance dataset stored in MySQL. The app converts queries into SQL, retrieves relevant data, and uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate clear and accurate answers.
